#Ranking methods
All ranking methods are subclasses of *URLRank*. We have given you one example *SimplicityURLRank* which ranks by the length of the URL the more parts to the URL the worse the rank.

We would like you to create your own within *SampleURLRank* here are some examples of how it could rank by:
1. The depth of the URL.
2. Depth or breadth first approach.
3. Given a sample document rank links higher that have more similar content to the sample document.
4. The social media links.
5. Content creation/modification
